SSG-48 adaptive electric gripper is a gripper based on **Spectral micro BLDC drivers**. It is a gripper capable of controlling its gripping force, making it perfect for assembly tasks and human-robot collaboration. Gripping force can be adjusted allowing you to grasp a wide range of items; from delicate and soft to rigid and sturdy.<br /> 

STL files are open source allowing you to add a custom griping tool and attach it to any robotic arm or robot. 

SSG-48 adaptive electric gripper is available as a fully assembled gripper or you can build your own by following assembly manual.

If you plan to build SSG-48 adaptive electric gripper by yourself you will need to source all the parts from [this BOM]().
After that you can follow the [assembly manual]() to assemble your gripper.

To power the gripper you need to use 24V. <br />
You can send commands to the gripper using 5V CAN bus. <br />
Check control page and learn how the gripper works. <br />
Check CAN protocol page if you wish to use gripper API.
