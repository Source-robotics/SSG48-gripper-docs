It is a gripper capable of controlling its gripping force, making it perfect for assembly tasks and human-robot collaboration. Gripping force can be adjusted allowing you to grasp a wide range of items; from delicate and soft to rigid and sturdy. </p> <p>STL files are open source allowing you to add a custom griping tool and attach it to any robotic arm or robot. </p> <p>SSG-48 adaptive electric gripper is available as a fully assembled gripper or you can build your own by following assembly manual.</p> <p>If you plan to build SSG-48 adaptive electric gripper by yourself you will need to source all the parts from this BOM. After that you can follow the assembly manual to assemble your gripper.</p> <p>General specs:</p> <ul> <li>Power supply: 24V</li> <li>Idle power: 0.5W</li> <li>Weight: 400 g</li> <li>Maximum gripping force: 20N</li> <li>Minimum gripping force: 1N</li> <li>Operating temperature -5 to 65 deg</li> <li>Communication interface: CAN bus</li> <li>Material: PETG plastic</li> <li>Stroke: 0 - 48 mm</li> </ul> <p> </p>"},{"location":"page1_about_the_gripper/#pinout","title":"Pinout","text":"<p>To power the gripper you need to use 24V.
